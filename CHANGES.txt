Changelog
=========

2.3.1
-----

* Requires Elgg 2.3.0 at minimum,
* No longer load lightbox JS and CSS because it's loaded by Elgg core everywhere anyway now.

2.0.1
-----

* Thorough code cleanup and re-work/modernization (thanks to Ismayil Khayredinov!),
* Alternative positions of Feedback button (extra menu or footer) in addition to left page border (again thanks to Ismayil Khayredinov),
* For feedback position extra menu and footer the feedback submit window opens in centered lightbox popup,
* Notification of admins on new feedback sent in language configured by the admin users,
* Link to member's profile page for feedback sent by site members (only works for new feedback).

2.0.0
-----

* Updated for Elgg 2.0 (therefore should also work on any future Elgg 2.X version).

1.10.5
------

* Usage of elgg_view_icon() instead of elgg-icon classes,
* Fixed usage of ajax_loader.gif,
* Improved identification of IP address of logged out visitors who give feedback and don't enter a name or email address,
* Fixed bug that resulted in the IP address of anonymous visitors getting lost on feedback submit,
* Improvements in layout of feedback content in list of feedback and feedback widget in admin area,
* composer.json added.

1.10.4
------

* Conversion of inline JS code into an AMD module.

1.10.3
------

* Version 1.9.3 updated for Elgg 1.10 (fixing of deprecation issues newly introduced in Elgg 1.10).

1.9.3
-----

* same as in 1.8.3 with corresponding css files both both the default theme and Aalborg theme.

1.8.3
-----

* useability improvement for small screens: if screen width is lower than 1030px the feedback button moves from the fixed left border position to above the footer. Feedback form width gets smaller, too. Feedback form layout has been slightly changed (radio buttons now vertically aligned) to take into account this variable form width.

1.9.2
-----

* (same as in 1.8.2) fix for submit, cancel and close buttons of feedback submit form supporting multiple languages (if translations provided in a language file),
* adjustments for Aalborg theme: two different CSS files for default Elgg theme and Aalborg theme respectively.

1.8.2
-----

* fix for submit, cancel and close buttons of feedback submit form supporting multiple languages (if translations provided in a language file).

1.9.1
-----

* Updated version 1.8.1 to work on Elgg 1.9.

1.8.1
-----

* Fixed sending of feedback when logged out (It seems this got broken by some change in an Elgg core version released since I published 1.8.0beta1. Unfortunately, any feedback created since then by a logged out user resulted in an invalid entity being created in the database - and these feedback entities do not show up in the admin section. Using the Database Validator plugin available at http://community.elgg.org/plugins/438616/1.4/database-validator you can clean up your database from these invalid entities easily though),
* Size of Feedback dialog window reduced and layout re-done,
* Feedback button is now built with vertical text instead of an image, so it can be translated to different languages,
* Works now with walled-garden option enabled or Loginrequired plugin installed,
* Removal of any code that is connected with captchas. This code was commented out anyway. Unfortunately, I haven't got it working as I wanted with utilization of a captcha plugin installed and proper refreshing of the captcha image when necessary (after successful posting of feedback or when the captcha text was entered wrong without manual reloading of the page). If anyone manages to implement a fully-working captcha check (I imagine only for logged-out users) I would be most delighted about a PR at the github repo of the Feedback plugin,
* Code cleanup.

1.8.0beta1
----------

* Initial release for Elgg 1.8,
* Captcha check (only used when logged out) currently commented out in code as it does not refresh in the way I would like to.
* For logged-out visitors it does not yet work with Elgg's walled-garden option enabled or when the Loginrequired plugin is used.
